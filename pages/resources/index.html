        Systems are complex. Careers can be even more so. This space is for women in
        engineering and those who support them — navigating impact, visibility, and
        sustainability in technical roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll be sharing stories, frameworks, and practical tools for staying both technical
        and human over the long haul.

      <p>
        Mentoring isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about sitting beside someone
        while they untangle their own complexity. My approach blends architecture thinking,
        narrative, and practical next steps.

      <h2 id="health-resilience">Health &amp; Resilience</h2>
      <p>
        I had a stroke. It reshaped how I think about time, impact, and what “high
        performance” really means. This isn’t medical advice — it’s one person’s story and
        some hard-earned perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll also point to official resources that can literally save lives when every
        minute matters.

        These themes show up across the site — in the blog, podcast, and toolkit. As new
        posts and episodes go live, I’ll link to them from here so you can move easily
        between the “human layer” and the technical work.
