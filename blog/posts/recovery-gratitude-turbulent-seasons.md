Some seasons arrive gently, and some announce themselves with force.  
This one was unmistakably the latter—loud, intense, and life-shifting in a way that left nothing untouched. It wasn’t quiet. It wasn’t subtle. It was a storm that reshaped me inside and out.

Earlier this year, I underwent major surgery. What followed in the first two weeks was far more complicated than expected—a cascade of urgent issues, including a second procedure, each demanding immediate attention. It was a period of bright lights, sharp pivots, and constant recalibration.

My leave of absence was always meant to be long. But any hope of returning earlier dissolved as the complications unfolded. Healing became my full-time focus. It was non-negotiable, and in its own way, deeply instructive.

## Redefining Grace and Strength

I’ve spent years building architectures that must endure pressure, adapt, and restore themselves with intention. Recovery mirrored that, but in deeply human terms.

Through this season, I learned that:

**Grace is not softness.**  
Grace is presence.  
Grace is composure in the middle of noise.  
Grace is choosing how you move, not pretending the turbulence isn’t there.

**Strength is not force.**  
Strength is steadiness.  
Strength is allowing yourself to heal without rushing your return.  
Strength is trusting your own design even when every metric feels unstable.

Both qualities became less about performance and more about alignment—less about holding everything together and more about letting myself be fully supported.

And in that space, I found something unexpected:  
a deeper calm, a deeper confidence, and a deeper sense of self than I have ever known.

## A Return Shaped by Intention

I’ll be returning after the new year, exactly on the timeline I originally planned—though by a far different route than I imagined. And despite the challenges, I’m coming back with a renewed sense of direction and a clearer connection to the work and communities I love.

There is so much I’m eager to step back into: new architectural initiatives, the Cisco Press video series, writing, creating—and continuing to grow *L8: The Butterfly Layer* into something meaningful and beautiful.

This chapter has reshaped me.  
Not dramatically on the surface, but subtly, profoundly, and elegantly at the core.

## With Gratitude

To everyone who checked in, covered for me, encouraged me, or simply held space—thank you. Your support mattered more than I can express. You helped carry me through a season that demanded every bit of patience, courage, and resilience I had.

I am grateful—deeply, quietly grateful.

Transformation takes courage.  
Recovery takes intention.  
And community—the people who stand with you—gives both their meaning.
