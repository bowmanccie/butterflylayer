We spend a lot of time talking about Layers 1–7.

Cables, optics, packets, protocols, APIs, applications.

But the most fragile, powerful layer in any architecture is the one that never gets a protocol number: the human layer. The butterfly layer.

It shows up in:

- who gets invited to the design review,
- which constraints are spoken out loud versus silently assumed,
- how we respond when a beautiful diagram meets a messy real-world migration.

L8: The Butterfly Layer is my shorthand for this space.

It’s where intent, empathy, elegance, and constraints collide — and where truly calm architectures are born.

Over time, this blog will explore:

- patterns for designing with intent (not just wishful thinking),
- ways to make complex networks feel *calmer* to operate,
- how AI changes the texture of architectural work,
- and what “engineering elegance” looks like in practice.

Where intent takes flight, architecture feels less like firefighting and more like choreography.

Welcome to the Butterfly Layer. 🦋
