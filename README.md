# L8: The Butterfly Layer

A modular, elegant personal brand and content platform for Jennifer Bowman — Principal Architect, author, and creator of *L8: The Butterfly Layer*. This repository contains:

- A maintainable, component-based website (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Podcast content and publishing structure
- Signature and brand assets
- Reference material for ongoing creative and technical work

## Brand Themes

- **Transformation** — symbolized by the butterfly
- **Elegance & Intent** — clear architecture, inside and out
- **Security & AI** — modern, intelligent multi-domain design

## Folder Overview

| Folder | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `site/` | Website files (HTML, CSS, JS, assets, pages) |
| `content/` | Podcast manuscripts, final audio/video, artwork |
| `reference/` | Inspiration, research, and non-production material |
| `ops/` | Checklists, licenses, documentation |

## Local Dev Notes

The website uses a simple HTML + JS include system:
- `site/partials/` holds shared header/footer
- `site/assets/js/loader.js` injects them into pages
- CSS variables live in `site/assets/css/variables.css`

This ensures easy maintenance and zero duplication.
